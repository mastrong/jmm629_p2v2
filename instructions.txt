In this project, each person will develop an exploratory tool, that is, an interactive web page that allows users to
investigate and understand data visually, using web technologies like <div>, <svg>, or <canvas> elements for their visual
representations.

Students can either build upon the chart created for Project 1 or start something new. In this case, you will have the
freedom to choose the dataset and visualization approach you wish to explore. The tool should enable user interaction
with the data visualization, whether through filters, selections, or clicks that display contextual information.
Consider elements like:

<select></select>
<input type="checkbox">
<input type="number">
<input type="text">
<button>

or any other means to interact with your chart (e.g., "click" event, "mouseover," etc.).

The evaluation of this project will be based on various criteria:

Technical Functionality: Are all interactive features effectively implemented?
Visual Design: Does the tool's interface present a well-designed visual aesthetic coherent with your topic and data?
Innovation and Creativity: Does the proposed tool offer an original and creative approach to exploring the data? (this
criterion is considered a "bonus").

Each submission should include:

A public link to the exploratory tool (it can be hosted on platforms like CodeSandbox or others).
A paragraph describing the studentâ€™s experience in developing the tool, including challenges faced and learnings.
A video showing someone interacting with your tool (such as a screen recording, with or without narration).
Any other materials like drafts, prototypes, etc., that can help communicate the idea and the development process.
